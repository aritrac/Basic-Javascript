Instructions
Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.

Hint
Try looking at the secondLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.

The thirdLetterOfLastName variable should have the value of v.
You should use bracket notation.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
//Since array indexing is 0 based, 2 means the third location in the array
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
